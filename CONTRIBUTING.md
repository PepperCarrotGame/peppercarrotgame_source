# Contributing

Of course improvements are accepted, please read the build instructions on the README, although here are some general guidelines that you may or may not follow:

* Make it all modular, this is not an RPG; this is a game that has multiple subsystems that can sustain different types of gameplay.
* Each serialized object should be a new class.
* Ensure that your changes are integrated with the save systems (see save_manager.gd).

# On the topic of art

Art should follow the style set by journey, some concept art was done, look at the docs repository under the art folder.

# Code of Conduct

There's absolutely no code of conduct, we are here to code.
